## L — Liskov substitution principle ##

- This one is probably the hardest one to wrap your head around when being introduced for the first time.

- In programming, the Liskov substitution principle states that if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced (or substituted) with objects of type S.

This can be formulated mathematically as
Let ϕ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T.
Then ϕ(y) should be true for objects y of type S, where S is a subtype of T.

- More generally it states that objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
